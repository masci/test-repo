prelude: >
    Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section for this
    release. This is equivalent to the "Highlights" section we used before.
    The prelude might repeat some details that are also present in other notes
    from the same release, that's ok. Not every release note requires a prelude,
    use it only to describe major features or notable changes.
upgrade:
  - |
    List upgrade notes here, or remove this section.
    Upgrade notes should be rare: only list known/potential breaking changes,
    or major changes that require user action before the upgrade.
    Notes here must include steps that users can follow to 1. know if they're
    affected and 2. handle the change gracefully on their end.
